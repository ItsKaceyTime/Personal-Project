A ROMHack with the end goal of making a more inclusive Harvest Moon for LGBTQ+ identities.

Currently planned features: 
  1: The ability to select your sprite between the "Boy" version of the game and the "Girl" version of the game with no further impact.
  2: The ability to select the pronouns used in reference to your character in dialog.
  3: The ability to choose your orientation, impacting which characters will be eligible spouses.
  4: Fix some rough translation issues, as well as remove the sexism present in the "Girl" version of the game.
  
Potentially more to come, depending on how development goes!
